    <p>Hi! My name is Garrett Brown! Thats me up there. ⬆️ I am a student at Kansas State university studying computer science with a minor in music. I love to tinker around with technology, create web pages, make tech videos, and hack (ethically, of course). I am also a member of the Pride of Wildcat Land and Catband.</p>
    <h1>💻 Technology</h1>
    <p>I have always loved working with technology, and finding cool things to do with it. I am a computer science major, hoping to go into cybersecurity. My dream job is to become a penetration tester, because I think it would be fun to hack in a way that could help people by stopping the bad guys. I am also a big right to repair and privacy advocate. I have been fixing computers for my family and friends since I was 13, and believe that everyone should have access to quality repair resources and easy repairs. I also like developing websites. You can see a few of them in the Projects section on the home page of this site.</p>
    <h1>🎼 Music</h1>
    <p>I am a trombonist in the Kansas State University Marching Band (Pride of Wildcat Land) and the Catband basketball band. I have been playing trombone since I was in 5th grade, and I was also a singer in various concert, church and show choirs from 5th grade til my senior year of high school, including the Lincoln East Express show choir, the MAMT European Honor Choir, and the 2017 and 2018 Nebraska All-State Choirs. I am also minoring in music at Kansas State.</p>
    <h1>📽️ Video</h1>
    <p>I create tech related videos on YouTube, LBRY, and PeerTube. I always enjoyed making videos for various classes in school, and taking video making classes over summers, and have always looked up to tech reviewers and video makers. I always wanted to start my own channel, but never had the time due to my busy school schedules. But now I work to make videos in my free time! These videos talk about how to do cool stuff with technology, and various cool topics in tech, like the decentralized internet, web development, and cybersecurity. You can find my videos by clicking on the "Videos" button in the header, or the links on the homepage</p>
    <h1>🗒️ Writing</h1>
    <p>I have a blog made with Jekyll where I usually write about tech stuff, but sometimes about things happening in my life. You can go there by hitting the "Blog" button in the header, and if you like it enough, you can add it to your <a href=https://saladhax.site/feed>RSS feed</a>!</p>
