<h1>The Budget Games: Making money management a bit more fun</h1>

<p class=blogtext>This one isn't really about tech like the rest of my posts, but it was something I found intriguing nonetheless. I've never been the best at keeping track of my spending and what I need to cut back on. I always tend to spend more than what I have set aside for my weekly spending cash, and sometimes I have money that I didn't spend in certain places that I could use in other places. But my friends in my dorm also had the same problem, and had an interesting idea on how to keep ourselves from overspending our money. </br>
</br>
One of them threw together a Google Sheets spreadsheet that would keep track of the money we make, and the money we spend, and let us know what all we had as far as money we could spend. He sent it to all of us so we could copy it over and modify it however we saw fit, and then we shared it with eachother so we could all see what we were spending. And whenever we see eachother or go out to get food, we always bring up the budget list, and update it. I had tried to do a similar thing with an app on my phone, but never really kept up with it. But I think the way we set this one up made it almost like a game, seeing who cold manage their money the best, which actually made keeping track of money stuff fun!<br/>
