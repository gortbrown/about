<h1>Replacing Linux on my Laptop with Windows 10, and how I Still Use Linux</h1>

<p class=blogtext>For a few years now, Linux has been the main operating system installed on my laptop. Before I started college, it did everything I needed it to, which was essentialy stuff you could do on any computer from a Gaming PC to the cheap Chromebooks they assigned every student. As I went through this past school year, my freshman year of college, Linux still did everything I needed it to. It ran all of the software I needed for computer science classes, and obviously still did well for writing papers and making presentations in other classes. The only time I needed Windows was when using Visual Studio 2019 for an introduction to C# and WinForm applications.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, I had switched to Windows because Linux didn't have webcam support on the Surface Laptop I was using at the time, which made Zoom calls dificult. Of course, that laptop bit the dust a few months back, and I picked up an ROG Zephyrus GA502, and since it didn't have a webcam to begin with, I hacked one together with an old phone of mine, and immediately switched back to Linux. Unfortunately, I found out too late that Linux didn't play nicely with the wireless card, the graphics and had troubles with fan control, causing the CPU to thermal throttle, and making the laptop a bit toasty. While I was able to figure out how to get things working on Manjaro, and partially on Ubuntu, there were still some problems that made it a little less than convenient for my setup.<br/>
<br/>
One problem was my tendancy to distro hop. I usually back all of my important stuff up onto an external hard drive, so changing things is as easy as double checking if I need to back anything up, creating an installer USB, and installing the new system. However, with this laptop, I needed to fire up my browser and figure out how to get whatever distro I was using fully up and running, then tinker with things. And even then, it sometimes has it's hiccups.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason is some programs that I couldn't get running through Wine or Valve Proton. I mentioned Visual Studio for C# a bit earlier, and while I know Monodevelop exists, I've never had experience with it, especially when it comes to creating programs with a GUI, which is something we will be doing in my next computer science class in the fall. I also recently purchased the PC port of Persona 4 Golden on Steam, thinking I could get it up and running on Wine or Proton, but I unfortunately couldn't get it to work. I thought about just setting up a VM to run these, but the experience wasn't very good, and I eventually ran into some issues with that. So I finally yielded, and decided to grab my Windows 10 restore drive, and reinstall Windows on my machine.<br/>
<br/>
However, I still use Linux every day. I have VMWare Workstation Pro installed on my machine, which I absolutely love to use. This is where I have my Linux VM. This makes it so I don't have to worry about any hardware compatability, and I can easily distro hop. It also allows me to move out of my Linux machine when I play games or use apps that won't run on Linux. I also have a horible tendancy to tinker around on Linux during class. I did a much better job avoiding this over 2nd semester, but with this setup, I can use Windows to do things in class, or work when I need to remove distractions, and have all of the fun stuff on my Linux VM so I can tinker to my heart's desire outside of class.<br/>
<br/>
While this doesn't prevent all of the things I hate about Windows, like the update system, it does make it so I can use Linux easily on my machine, and still use Windows when I absolutely need to.<br/>
