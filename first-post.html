<p class=blogtext>    Hello world! This is my first blog post! I got a bit bored, so I decided to add blogging to my website. Here, I will post my thoughts on different tech news happening around the world that interests me. For example, I just installed the Android 11 beta on my Pixel, and I will probably post my thoughts on that in a blog post sometime soon. Anyway, thats about it. Bye!</p>
