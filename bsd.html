<p class="blogpost"> I've been using Linux for a long while, and I love it! I finally figured out how to get Linux running well on my laptop, and I've figured out how to handle the things I needed Windows for. However, I've seen many things about the
Berkeley Software Distribution, but never really looked into it. So I figured I would give it a shot.<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded a distro I had heard good things about called GhostBSD, which is based on FreeBSD. I downloaded Virtualbox, installed GhostBSD, and now I'm using it for most of my basic stuff. I'm even writing this post on it. My first
Impression is that it feels fairly similar to Linux. A good amount of the basic commands are the same, and a lot of popular programs also work. However, I can't actually use this as a main OS since some of the drivers I use to make my
wireless card work won't work on GhostBSD, and I know some of the software I use aren't available either. But I'm still excited to try it out more and see if I can use it as a secondary OS for doing basic stuff.<br/>
