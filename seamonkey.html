<h1>A Modern Look at the Past: Seamonkey Navigator</h1>

<p class="blogtext">I never used Netscape Navigator when I was younger. My family always used Internet Explorer on our Windows PCs. But I've always seen videos and learned in computer science classes about how innovative Mosaic and Netscape were in the earlier days of the internet, and always wanted to try it. I figured the closest I would ever get to using it without searching for an old Netscape installer would be Firefox, as it was based on the same engine and source code, but then I found Seamonkey. Seamonkey is based on the Mozilla Application Suite, which was the open source continuation of Netscape. And while it's aesthetics make it look like some outdated browser from the early 2000s, it's actually a very modern browser, and is still maintained today! I decided to take it for a spin. <br/>
<br/>
Installation was normal. I ended up downloading the archive file, extracting it, then creating the .desktop file to launch the program, but you can install it through your distro's package manager. Launching it shows the classic Netscape user interface, down to the Seamonkey logo in the corner where the Netscape logo used to be. Using it is just like using any other browser. You can enter in a URL to the address bar, or enter a search query to search DuckDuckGo. There's a bookmark bar, the usual navigation buttons, and you can even add some extensions. It also comes with the other parts of the Mozilla Application Suite, such as an email client and contact book, (which works a lot like Thunderbird,) a tool for making basic webpages, and the ChatZilla IRC client. While some might not like the dated design, and prefer the modern features of Chrome or Firefox, Seamonkey is not only a great browser, but it also brings a bit of nostalgia to those who remember Netscape, or even older browsers of the early 2000s.<br/>
