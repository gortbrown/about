<h1>2020: The Year Smartphones got Exciting Again</h1>

<p class=blogtext>I was too young to see the beginning of the modern smartphone era. The only exposure I even had to smartphones was when my dad got an iPhone 2G that his workplace issued him, and the occasional
Motorola Droid commerial. I started getting into tech when I was in 6th grade, which was around 2012 or 2013, and it started with smartphone tech. Me and a firend of mine in our middle school
trombone section had a debate over whether or not iPhone or Android was better, and I learned a lot about smartphones when looking into ways that Android was better that I didn't already
know from using my old Nook HD tablet. And looking back, I'd say I got interested right before smartphones "got boring." Even though most phones were starting to go towards what we see today,
 where every phone is just a metal and glass slab with a big screen, it still seemed like each smartphone was unique, and had it's own awesome features. For example, the Nexus phones gave us 
a look at what was new with Android, the Moto X, Droid, and earlier Moto Z devices always brought something interesting to the table, and the Galaxy line of phones always brought everything 
and the kitchen sink to their smartphones. There were even some smaller devices that were really interesting, like the OnePlus One back in 2014, and the return of Blackberry and their Keyboards
in 2015. But once smartphones started pushing the bounderies of how much of the front surface could be taken up by screen, things started to slow down. Almost all phones started to move to 
big screens with either a notch, a hole punch, or a pop-up camera, a glass and metal build, and multiple cameras. Things got, well, a little boring. And while this is still kind of the case 
with a lot of phones, there are a lot of different smartphones that are bringing something new to the table. I think this is the start of a more exciting stretch of time in the smartphone realm.<br/>
<br/>
One example is with folding phones, and phones that have the option to expand screen area. Now, I know folding phones have been around for almost a year now, but we're getting into the second 
generation of folding phones, and a lot of the kinks from the first generation are being ironed out. This can allow for a lot of different form factors that all seem to point to one concept: 
having a bigger screen when you need it, and a smaller one when you don't. Whether or not it's a normal sized phone that can get smaller when it's more convenient, or a normal sized phone that 
can become a tablet when it's more convenient, the idea of having that kind of flexibility (no pun intended) is great! And for those who don't want to deal with the possibly fragility of these 
flexible displays, there are other phones taking a different approach to this idea. Take the Surface Duo and the dual screen case for various LG phones for example. It's essentially the same 
concept as phones like the Galaxy Fold, but with two seperate screens. It doesn't do as well when using one app spanned over both halves, but it still makes things easier for those who want 
the extra screen room for multitasking. We also just got the LG Wing today, which looks like a normal phone on the surface, but has a screen that swivels up to a horizontal orientation, and 
reveals a smaller display underneath it, allowing you do more than one thing at one, and even use extra functions in certain apps like the camera. It's a fairly simple concept, regardless of 
whether or not the screen tech is cutting edge, but its definately an interesting one.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting thing that's starting to happen is the emergence of new platforms. At the beginning of the modern smartphone age, there were a plethora of different smartphone OSes competing 
for a spot in our pocket. But today, there are really only two big players: Android, and iOS. But that might be changing. For example, Kai OS is starting to pick up momentum in entry-level markets.
Kai OS is made to bring smart featrues to feature phones, allowing people who might not be able to afford a more expensive smartphone, or those who don't really need more than the basics, 
get smarter features. As for more traditional smartphones, there are a lot of new projects in the works that I think could compete really well! Huawei just announced that they are making their own 
OS to replace Android, as they are no longer able to use certain parts of Android. Google has also been working on Fuchsia OS, and while we haven't really seen much about that recently, it 
is still being worked on, and might even replace Android eventually. And finally, I can't talk about new smartphone OSes without mentioning Linux on mobile. I recently purchased the PinePhone, 
and have been playing around with all of the different distros out there, and its promising! Most of them seem to have the basics down, and I think once the bugs have been ironed out, the features 
get better, (battery life, camera, app scaling, etc.) and the AnBox platform gets to the point that you can run most Android apps well, it should be a great option for those who want something different, 
open-source, and privacy focused.<br/>
<br/>
I've always been a fan of smartphone technology, but within the past couple of years, I have noticed that I haven't been as excited about new devices as I used to be. But with all of these 
new things coming out, I'm starting to feel the same excitement I used to feel when new devices were announced!<br/>
