<p class="blogtext">I'm finally getting back to writing blog posts! I haven't had as much time to just sit down and write stuff for the past month. A lot of stuff has been happening, from my summer job, to preparing for college to start up again. Its been a bit of a hectic month.<br/>
<br/>
The job I did this summer is the same job I've done every summer: Detasseling. For those who haven't heard of this before, it's where a bunch of teenagers and college students go into a cornfield and either pull out the tassel (the part that polinates the plant) from the corn  plant, or cut down the types of corn that don't belong in that field. My job was the latter. Its a good job! It pays well, and I only have to do stuff for a couple weeks during the summer, which made it great for balancing activities and schoolwork in high school, and to a lesser extent, now in college. Getting up at 4 in the morning wasn't all that great though, so I'm glad to be done with it, and glad to have a normal sleep schedule again.<br/>
<br/>
I also just finished getting some stuff ready for moving to college in a few weeks. I had to figure out some stuff with my schedule, as one of my classes didn't make it on my schedule because I hadn't declared the minor I needed to take it. This presented a problem as I needed a certain amount of credit hours to keep a scholarship. Luckilly, I got that all taken care of. I also found out that my roomate had all of his classes moved online, so he would be staying home for the semester. That kind of sucked, but I also have a dorm room to myself now, so that's fun.<br/>
<br/>
Now with all of that out of the way, I can finally get back to working on coding projects and writing blog posts. The start of the school year might change that, but I figure my class load won't be heavy enough to take up all of my free time.<br/>
