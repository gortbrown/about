blog in Jekyll</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">---</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I’ve used a few
different services for my blogs over the years. I had a tech blog
back in early high school that I made with Weebly, then when I
created the blog I have now about half a year ago, I just created
html files that I would upload to my site. Needless to say, this got
a bit tedious having to copy an html file, rewrite certain parts,
then upload it, so I moved my blog over to &lt;a
href=<a href="https://wordsmith.social/">https://wordsmith.social</a>&gt;WordSmith&lt;/a&gt;.
This was working out well for a while! I really liked WordSmith. But
then I decided to redesign my website, as I was tired of the old 90s
aesthetic, and I was bored due to the fact that I am on winter break.
So while redesigning the site, I decided to try Jekyll for the heck
of it.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">At first, things
were a bit odd. I didn’t quite know how to port my current site
over. But after combing through the documentation, I finally got the
gist of it. I created the layout files for the site (which make
changing things across all of the pages SO much easier), and all of
the different pages. Then I worked on figuring out the actual
blogging part of it. This was pretty easy as well. I just created a
new layout file for blog posts, and ported over all of my old posts
from WordSmith. This part was a bit harder, since the importer tool
that worked with my site wouldn’t run, so I did it all manually.
This wasn’t too hard since it was just a matter of copying the
content over and pointing the post’s html file to the post layout.
Then, I wrote my first post on it. It was pretty easy to use! I feel
it strikes a good balance of ease and fun, since I can host the blog
on my own actual site, and not have to deal with the hassle I dealt
with before.  I was even able to make some changes that made things
better after reading the &lt;a
href=”https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/”&gt;awesome
article&lt;/a&gt; Kev Quirk wrote about making a Jekyll site with his
&lt;a href=simplecss.org&gt;simple.css&lt;/a&gt; framework (which is
what I use for the style of the site) like adding more to my footer,
or adding Jekyll’s sitemap plugin for better compatibility with
search engines. I think I can easily say that I’ve found a blogging
platform that I am happy with!</p>
