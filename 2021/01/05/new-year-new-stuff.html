<p>05 Jan 2021 - Garrett Brown</p>

There are a lot of thing's I've always wanted to do, but I always kind of forgot about them since I never had much time, or because I just got lazy and decided to push them off until I just forgot about them. But after the dumpster fire that was 2020, and a bunch of staying at home doing nothing, I decided to start the new year off by doing some of the things I've been wanting to do for a while, and trying to stick with them as best as I could.

First thing is starting a YouTube channel. Ever since I started watching videos by YouTubers like MKBHD and Linus Tech Tips, I've always thought it would be fun to have a YouTube channel of my own for tech stuff. Of course, since I was a very involved person all throughout high school, I never had time. I also tried to hold myself to a high standard for my videos, and make videos like the YouTubers mentioned above, which just made things harder. But now, I've decided it would be fun to start making videos on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzS5DN4n02KM9bdX2OqmwfQ>YouTube</a>, <a href=https://lbry.tv/@saladhax:0>LBRY</a>, and <a href=https://diode.zone/video-channels/saladhax_tech/videos>PeerTube</a>! I've also decided to take a different approach in making my videos than I had before. No scripts, no unnecessary fancy stuff, no unnecessary planning, just point the webcam at myself, talk, and do things on my computer if necessary. That should make things simpler, take up less time, and make things a little more fun!

I've also started to work more on cybersecurity stuff. I've been wanting to learn some more cybersecurity stuff for a while now, since it interests me, and I haven't gotten that far in my college classes yet. I started working with <a href=https://tryhackme.com>TryHackMe</a> a while ago, but just kinda got lazy and forgot about it. And while I did have classes and marching band to worry about, I still just kind of spent free time watching TV. But now, I've given myself the challenge of doing a small bit of TryHackMe every day I can. I feel like this will not only give me a head start for my cybersecurity classes later on, but it will also be a fun thing to do when I'm bored.

Finally, I'm going to try and get back into running. I've been running for fun since I was in 4th grade, and I did cross country and track all through out middle school and high school, as well as ran a couple of half marathons. Then, college came along. My first semester, classes and marching band kept me reasonably busy, so I didn't get much of a chance to run. Then Covid happened, and with the lockdown, and the general idea of staying inside, I just never got around to running. I also gained the "Freshman 15" over my freshman year, which didn't help. But I always had fun going out on runs, so I might try to find a place to run in the town my college is in, and try to go on a run every once in a while.

Now, will I run out of time to do some of this? Maybe. But I figured it would be a fun thing to try in case I don't!
