<h1>Android 11 Beta: My thoughts</h1>

<p class=blogtext>    I've always loved using beta software. The idea of getting to test out the future of whatever the developer has to offer, as well as getting to give feedback on what works and what doesn't. The first beta test I ever participated in was the iOS 8 preview on my iPod touch in 8th grade. It was really fun getting to see the new features that would be coming to iDevices ahead of time, and it was well worth the process of trying to get it without a developer account, (since iOS didn't have public beta's until iOS 9.) After iOS 9, my iPod became outdated and wasn't supported by iOS 10, so I moved to beta testing apps on Android, and testing on the Windows Insider Program. But I still missed getting to install a beta update on a mobile device, since my Droid Turbo didn't ever get any betas, and never really got updates in a timely matter in the first place. But flash forward about 5 years, and I now have a Pixel 3a, meaning I could FINALLY install a beta update on my phone! <br/>
<br/>
    Looking back on previous versions of Android I've used, Android updates have mostly comprised of backend improvements. Maybe some design aspects were refined, and one or two big user facing features were added, but compared to the bigger changes that would happen in earlier versions from the first half of the 2010s, there weren't many huge changes between versions. This kind of continues with the Android 11 beta. At first glance, things seem like a slightly more refined Android 10. But looking deeper, there are actually quite a few exciting changes.<br/>
<br/>
    Starting off with the notifications, you'll see your notifications split into 3 catagories. The usuall Alerting Notifications and Silent Notifications sections are still there, but there's a new Conversations section for messages. All of your text message notifications, no matter what app they come from, show up at the top, which is really great! I've had plenty of times where I've missed messages because different apps thought their notifications were more important than my new messages. Now, I don't have to worry about Facebook thinking I care about someone posting on their story more than important messages from the trombone section group chat, or a tech question from my mother.<br/>
<br/>
    Android 11 also brings bubbles to conversations. I've always loved the Chat Heads feature in Facebook Messenger, but I didn't want to use it for my default SMS app. Unfortunately, Messenger is still the only app that works with this so far, and I was only able to try it out for a little bit before it started crashing. Now if a bubble pops up from Messenger, tapping it just makes the bubble dissappear. However, Android Messages is getting the feature this week, so I'll be excited to see if it works better with that!<br/>
<br/>
    Another new feature I love is the new power menu. When they added Google Pay to the power menu, I liked the move, as I use it a lot when paying for food at places that support it, or when getting a snack out of the dorm vending machines. Now in Android 11, we also get smart device controls. This makes the task of turning my smart lights on and off throughout the day much easier! It even lets you drag on the controls to change the brightness, which is also a useful feature.<br/>
<br/>
    Android 11 also brings improved privacy features. It gives you more controls for your data, and adds some new changes to permissions. It lets you grant one-time access for camera, microphone, and location, meaning that if you only want an app to have access to something, but only once, you can do that. They've even moved the "Always Enable" option for location to the actual settings, leaving the "While using the app" and "Only Once" options as the only options in the popup. Android will even detect when an app hasn't been used in a while, and revoke it's permissions until you grant them again.<br/>
<br/>
    There are quite a few other cool features in this beta, such as a new screenshot interface, the relocation of media controls to the control panel, and app suggestions in the dock, (if you're into that,) but the features above are the ones that excite me most. And of course, there are its share of bugs. I mentioned the bubbles a bit earlier, but the system UI also crashes every once in a while. The screen will go black for a few seconds, then the lock screen will appear again. All running apps are still running, but the UI just seems to crash. This is rare though, as I think its only happened to me 3 or 4 times since I installed the beta, and it doesn't affect much. Regardless, I love this beta! I'm not only excited about this since it's my first mobile os beta since the 9th grade, but because it brings a lot of awesome features to Android! For those who use Android, you will not be dissappointed with this update when it comes out in the fall.<br/>
